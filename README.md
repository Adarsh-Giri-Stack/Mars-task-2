Mars task-2 was similar to task one, but this time we had to do it offline with real
components and the task was given on the spot. 
the task was to use a dc motor and control it using a push button. we also had to control and adjust the speed and 
direction of spin . 
so first i thought about the components i am going to use which were as follows :
  1. potentiometer- to control speed and adjust direction
  2. power driver- since dc motor requires more than 5V , we use this to amplify the voltage
  3. arduino uno r3
  4. DC motor
  5. 9V battery

Procedure:
Potentiometer:
terminal 1 to 5V arduino 
terminal 2 to Gnd 
wiper to analog pin 1
